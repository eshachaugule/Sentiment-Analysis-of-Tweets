# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Tweets

This project aims at sentiment analysis of tweets using live tweets from Twitterâ€™s API. The API had thousands of tweets coming in every second, most of which include slang or abbreviations not easily understood by a machine as well as special characters that need to be cleaned. I used Word2Vec embedding to remove words with low similarity scores and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling to exclude off-topic tweets. I vectorized the data and implemented various classification algorithms to compare accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.
